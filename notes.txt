Audio Problem: 

So I can get the first song to play and I have a global variable in web.js 
called audioIsPlaying I need a way to find out when the audio is done playing 
so that I can change that variable once the variable is changed the code is 
already in place to play the next song in the audioqueue

Lights Queue:

There is a problem with the timing and the negative numbers are still showing
up in the UI plus the patterns are not running for the right amount of time

Audio Queue: 

there is a socket.emit that uses 'getAudioQueue' that sends the audio queue out
when it recieves something that is sent to it. take a look at it not sure 
what to do about the time and the time between songs. We could look up the 
length of each song and add another array with those times or we could figure
out how to get it out of the file because it does display that info in the 
console while it is playing, or we could just not worry about it and just send
a signal to change it once a song is done playing.
